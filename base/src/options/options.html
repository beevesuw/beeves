  /*If you want to share data or functions between the JavaScript on your options 
  page and your background script(s), you can do so directly by obtaining a 
  reference to the Window of your background scripts by using extension.getBackgroundPage(), 
  or a reference to the Window of any of the pages running within your extension with 
  extension.getViews(). Alternately, you can communicate between the JavaScript for your 
  options page and your background script(s) using runtime.sendMessage(), runtime.onMessage, 
  and/or runtime.connect(). The latter (or runtime.Port equivalents) can also be used to 
  share options between your background script(s) and your content script(s).
  In general, you will want to store options changed on option pages using the storage 
  API to either storage.sync (if you want the settings synchronized across all instances of 
  that browser that the user is logged into), or storage.local (if the settings are local to 
  the current machine/profile). If you do so and your background script(s) (or content script(s)) 
  need to know about the change, your script(s) might choose to add a listener to storage.onChanged.
